# Ideas and Cool Examples

- [Cheesy NASA video about cool telemetry analysis tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=11&v=22hfUd7NCSE). We obviously don't have to be anywhere near as feature-complete as this tool, but the video gives you a good idea of what most telemetry monitoring software looks like. We could definitely come up with some better visualizations for live data as well as for reviewing past data.
